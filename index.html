      <h2>Journalistic Account</h2>
      <p>The small island of Cuba has been dealing with a concerning water crisis dating back to before 1959. 
        With its deteriorating infrastructure, Cuba has been facing issues ranging from drinking water contamination, sewage pipe corrosion, as well as drought intensity.
        Extreme droughts were reported affecting croplands and water availability.
        In 2008 Cuba became prey to four hurricanes in succession (Fay, Gustav, Ike, Paloma) and damaged 647,111 houses, with 13% of them being completed destroyed.
        There is also the increase of saline intrusion into the country's groundwater, which puts agriculture at high risk of contamination. Independent studies consistently reveal that the perceived quality of drinking water among Cuban residents and tourists is poor.
        The main anthropogenic cause is the infrastructure, as when water arrives through municipal systems, it is often under low pressure, allowing bacteria and other foreign material to enter distribution.
        As reported by the National Institute of Hydraulic Resources (INRH), in early 2025, only 61.2% of the population had access to "risk-free" drinking water services, defined as being available when needed, and free from faecal and chemical contamination.
        According to several sources, Hepatitis A, typhoid, polio, and cholera are among the diseases that spread through drinking water.
        Cuba has faced cholera outbreaks in the past, with significant cases reported in 2012 and 2015.
        The Ministry of Science, Technology, and the Environment (CITMA) announced a national plan in 2018 called "Tarea Vida", which included upgrading water infrastructure and maintenance to slow down the effects of climate change impact.
        The INRH reported installing 241 kilometers of new water supply networks, along with 32 water treatment plants in 2024.
        While tourism will offer economic gains, an increase in tourism is likely to increase water pollution, further straining the drinking water system.

    <section id="Fact vs Fiction" class="info-section">
      <h2>Fact vs Fiction</h2> 
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Fact: </strong>Diseases like cholera, hepatitis A, typhoid, and polio have been linked to contaminated drinking water in Cuba.</li>
        <li><strong>Fiction: </strong>Cuba's government provides safe water access to nearly everyone. Reality: Government statistics conflict with independent research showing much lower safe access rates.</li>
        <li><strong>Fact: </strong>Cuba's outdated pipes corrode, releasing harmful metals like iron copper and lead into drinking water.</li>
        <li><strong>Fiction: </strong>Tourism only benefits Cuba's economy without impacting water supplies. Reality: Projected growth expected to strain water resources a lot more.</li>
        <li><strong>Fact: </strong>Climate change is worsening Cuba's water crisis, increasing droughts, hurricanes, and saline intrusion in aquifers.</li>
